Owen Wisher's Greatest Novel v
LADY BALTIMORE
Mr. Wister has preferred to leave his old field for an
entirely new one. Instead of the open plains, the
scene is a historic city. Instead of the open frontier
life, we see the pink of civilization. And instead of
rollicking cowboys, it is delightful women, old and
young, in whose company we find ourselves. Unlike
the "Virginian," in every way, yet "Lady Baltimore"
is a sterling success. Mr. Wister has seen and seized
another piece of American life, and has given it to
us alive. Those familiar with Mr. AVister's style will
find it here made to match the delicate tone of high
comedy which is the essence of this new departure in
American fiction. Price, postpaid, $1.50.

LEWIS A. CROSSETT. Inc.
NORTH ABINGTON MASS,
Chief Justice Kent returned home
yesterday morning after an absence of
ji month. He had planned to spend the
summer in the east, but the passage of
tlie statehood bill made his return at
this time necessary, that he might, as
directed by the bill, participate in the
apportionment of the delegates to the
constitutional convention. He there
fore hurled his eastern engagements,
thougli he spent some time in each
Maine, Massachusetts, New York and
Washington, D. C. Among the most
pleasant weeks of his outing was tiiat
spent in Boston during the commence
ment at Harvard, from which univers
ity he i-- a graduate.
Judge Xvent said, yesterday that it is
not at all likely he will return east
again this summer. He was pleased to
note that sprinkling had been resumed
and the city is now more habitabe.
The weather, too, is not as oppressive
as he ieared it might be, unless one
gets too much of it all at once. He
said his plans now are to stay here a
week or ten days, or longer, then go
to Preseott for a short time and after
that he will perhaps go to the coast
and remain until cooler weather.
The most natural thing in the world
was to interrogate Judge Kent concern
ing the statehood question and particu
larly regarding his visit with the presi
dent, wherein that subject would most
likely bt referred to. He replied that
he was called to Washington with Gov
ernor Kibbey for a conference with the
president concerning Arizona affairs
generally and statehood of course was
one of the subjects discussed.
"I am still opposed to jointure, for I
do not believe it would be a good thing
for Arizona, and" I have, not changed
my views in any way on this matter
since leaving the territory," said Judge
Kent, "but the president is very decid
edly in favor of jointure'and I believe
he is t irmly and honestly convinced
that it wi!l be for the welfare of the
people of the two territories to accept
it." However, Judge Kent said he de
sired it to be stated as strongly as lan
guage could put it, that the president
made no effort to coerce any federal
appointee in the acceptance of his
views, nor would hii knowingly permit 1
any federal appointee to coerce the!
voters of the territory, through the in-I
flucnce of his office, into favoring
either side of tlie jointure question.
The president believes just as all hon
est men believe, that it is a subject on
which the individual voter should have
the fullest and freest right to express
himself. And that applies to the office
holder as well. Arizona is for Arl
zonians and whether a man be a pri
vate citizen or the holder of a federal
oflice, the president has no desire to
curtail his liberty of free speech, free
action and his own free will at the
ballot box. The office holder may talk
as he likes and vote as he likes but he
must not undertake to exert an influ
ence on the question through the influ
ence of his office. Jude Kent said his
sentiments concerning his interview
with the president had been well ex
pressed in the report of it as given
publicity by Governor Kibbey.
The sentiment, of the: administration
and that of the president is that "the
time is near at hand when there should
be no more territories within the con
tinental boundaries of the country. The
sooner they can be molded into states,
leaving no territorial governments, ex
cept the insular possessions, the sooner
may be enacted a uniform set of laws
that will govern and control In all re
maining territories. Such a policy is
not now practicable for laws that are
now necessary in some of the far-away
islands would be manifestly unjust to
Arizona, and vice versa.
The president is very much interested
m the welfare of. Arizona and New
Mexico and has many warm personal
friends in both territories. He sin
cerely believes in the wisdom of joint
ure, but he is also firm in his doctrine
that if the people o these territories
really do not want it, it is a choice
that should be respected.
A COLORADO FLOOD
SWEEPS A CANYON
Residents Pass the Night in the Hills
in a Drenching Rain.
Pueblo, Col.. July 11. A special from
Trinidad to the Chieftain says: A
hundred people why live in Rhodes j
canyon, fifteen mile north of this city, j
are tonight sleeping in a drenching)
rain on the hills to escape a terrible;
Hood that is raging in that canyon. 1
One man, whose name is unknown,
was found tonight, drowned, at Her
wind. Seven houses and the stores of
the mining .cunip of Tobasco have been!
washed away as the water came down)
the arroya tonight, carrying several!
cattle and horses with it. All bridges
across the streams, including the Col
01 ado & Southern railroad bridge at
Tobasco, have been washed out. Tiie
southbound train, due here at 7:30 p.
111., is held on the north bank of the
canyon.
The Hood in the city is doing con
siderable damage, and tonight at 6
o'clock a number of buildings along the

one well to a dvpth of 24" feet. When
we were down to a depth of 24c feet
we came to a stratum of water bearing '
gravel. We kept on boring and finally
came to a conglomerate cement and
limestone formation.
"When we came to the. conglomerate'
formation all of the fears that I ever j
entertained as to the size of the flow (
vanished, because I have never yet j
failed to find below this formation an t
abundance of water. The well is '
twelve incl.es in diameter and at t"n !
present time is lined with riveted well
casing. As soon as we get through the j
conglomerate I will perforate this cas- j
ir.g and then the well will begin to
flow. 1 -
"At the present time we are . abso
lutely sure of a flow of from 800 to liwO
gallons of water a minute. I cannot
say now just how many wells it will
be necessary to sink, because that will
be governed by the quantity of water
we strike below the conglomerate for
mation in the first well. It may be:
necessary to sink ten wells atid on the
01 her hand, it may only be ne essary t"
sink five, but in any event we will sink
enough wells to irrigate that district. .
