DEATH COMES TO
GENERAL SICKLES
Last of Commanders at Gettysburg
I'um Away
WIFE WAS AT HIS BEDSIDE
They Had Been Estranged for Years
Later Years of life of the
Warrior Were Full of
Troubles
New York. May 4. General Dan
lei E. Sickles died at his home
shortly after 9 o'clock laat night.
Hla wife was at his bedside at the
end.
General Daniel Edgar Sicklea was
the last of the great commanders
who fought the battle of Gettysburg.
For a decade he was a fighter by
profession all his life he was a
fighter by nature.
His Indomitable fighting spirit
remained to the last. Born in New
York city in 1825, Sicklea, at the
age of 22, fought the Whigs as a
Democrat in the New York legisla
ture. At 28 he displayed his fight
ing spirit as corporation attorney of
New York. It was he who secured
for his city Its great Central park.
At this time his military career be
gan as major of the Twelfth regi
ment, national guard of New York.
Before he was 32 years old. Ma
jor Sickles had served as secretary
of legation at London under Min
ister James Buchanan; he had won
a state senatorship through a bit
ter campaign; and he was seated in
the Thirty-fifth congress at Wash
ington.
Sickles had begun his second,
term as congressman in 1859 when
the national capital was stirred by
the news that the young represen
tative from New York had shot and
killed Philip Barton Key, the Unit
ed States district attorney for the
district of Columbia. Sickles de
clared that Key had misled Mrs.
Sickles, who was There Bagioli,
daughter of an Italian music teach
er. The trial lasted 20 days, ending
in the acquittal of Sickles on the
ground of "unwritten law." He then
took his erring wife back. Mrs.
Sickles died of a broken heart a
few years later.
While minister to Spain, General
Sickles married Senonta Creagh.
This marriage was followed by an
estrangement lasting a quarter of a
century.
At the outbreak of the Civil war
Sickles raised the famous Excelsior
brigade in New York, taking com
mand of one of its regiments as
colonel. Lincoln in 1861 raised him
to brigadier general. His fighting
spirit early won him his spurs. "

Instructions tn View of Mexi

AtUtnde
for
Washington, May 4. Dispatchers
from Brigadier General Funaton on
the situation at Vera Crux were the
subject of a long conference at the
war department between Secretary
Garrison and Major General Woth
erspoon, chief of staff of the army.
It was said General Funaton had
asked for instructions In view of the
hostile attitude of the Mexican army
near the city.
Earlier in the day the general re
ported that the American outposts
at Vera Crus were being watched by
Mexicans and there were more than
10,000 Mexican troops encamped in
the vicinity.
General Funaton In a dispatch
says that tbe ottlcer in command
of the Mexican troops which attack
ed the American forces at the pump
ing plant was Major Zapota of the
engineer corps of the Mexican army.
He refers to the fact that very lit
tle dependable news about the con
ditions in the interior is coming in,
because no more refugees are now
coming into Vera Cruz. It is re
ported to him that General Maas
has about 4000 men at Coledad, and
that there are un unknown number
watching our lines. He believes the
Mexicans have five thousand troops
at Jalapa and about 1500 at Palma
where they are throwing up defenses.

UPTON SINCLAIR ARRESTED
HUERTA READY TO STEP OUT?
Humors Say He Wants Only
Conduct Away
Safe
Vera Cruz, May 4. Persistent
rumors continue to circulate here
that General Huerta intends to re
tire from the provisional presi
dency of Mexico on condition that,
he be assured a safe conduct to a
port and placed on board a foreign
warship.
It is declared in some Mexican
circles in this city that General
Huerta was ready to resign a week
ago, but was prevented from doing
so by internal dissensions in his
cabinet.
The disappearance from the Mex
ican cabinet of Jose Lopez Portillo
y Rojas, the foreign mislter, cou
pled with reports that there is a
growing undercurrent of feeling in
the City of Mexico against the
Huerta government, is interpreted
here as foreshadowing a change in
the situation in the federal capital.

MANHATTAN WILL
HAVE MILK
Salina. April 30. The wheat hav
ing grown to a foot or more tall, an
unusual growth for the first of May,
the farmers are running mowers
set at a high gauge through, their
fielda, taking off from four to six
inches of the blades. This method
has been adopted to prevent the
plant from going all to stem with
little heads. This has been done in
this part of the state but only once
or twice before but not after the
fields had been pastured as they
have during the past winter. The
wheat plant is now 12 inches high
and growing rank. Farmers say that
with the exception of the rankness
the growing crop is in exceptionally
fine condition.
Coffeyville, April 30. A fist
fight engaged in by Lemuel W. Bur
gin, who is known more generally
as "Blackie," and Vernon Oakley,
rresulted in the death of the former.
The fight took place In the alley
In the rear of "Dave's Place," a pool
hall at 821 Union street, the argu
ment which caused all the trouble
having been started while the men
were in front of the place. They re
tired to settle the argument.
Vernon was challenged by Bur
gin to a fight, in which Burgin re
ceived the first blow, a strike on
the jaw, which knocked him to the
pavement and rendered him unconscious.
