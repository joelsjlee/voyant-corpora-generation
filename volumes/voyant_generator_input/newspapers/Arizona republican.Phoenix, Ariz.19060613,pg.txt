Kngineer Alexander Potter, the en
gineer employed by the city for the:
construction of the mun'oipal water
works plant, accompanied by Mrs. Pot-
tcr. arrived here yesterday from New
York and are guests of the Hotel,
Adams. Mr. Potter, as has been an- j

coming west by being summoned at a!
witness in a lawsuit, though his plans:
and other data preceded him in accord-I
ance with the stipulated time. His per
sonal delay, however, has worked no

since the Injunction suit was brought

GIRL'S SECTIONAL TUCKED
DRESS 5344.
With Straight Lower Edges Suitable
for Embroidery.
The popularity of the p:inceK"e ef
fect has extended its influence even in
to the children's realm, and the latest
dresses designed for little girls show
evidences thereof. Here Is one that ta
dainty in the extreme and that is es
pecially designed to be made from the
many pretty bordered materials of the
season, although It can be utilized for
Plain fabrics a.s well. In the illustra
tion, emoroidered flouncing is com
bined with white lawn and with lace
banding, the effect being a most satis
factory and charming one. but there
are numberless other appropriate ma
terials well suited to the design, while
plain materials that are trimmed to
the edges can be made effective. Hems
and tucks are always pretty and quite
sufficient for the simpler dresses or
some simple design of embroidery can
be executed above the hems.
The dress is made with the waist
portion and two flounces. Each flounce
is tucked at Cue upper edge and the
dress is tucked at the waist line to
give a girdle effect. When the lining
is omitted these last are siayed r.It'.i a
straight belt. The bertha is a simple
one, tucked at the neck edge, and can
be either mitred or gathered at the
corners and the short sleeves are gath
ered at the full upper edg?s, tucked at
the lower and finished with straight
bands. When embroidered flouncing Is
used, plain materia', is joined to the
flouncing to form the waist, the seam
being concealed by the band of Inser
tion. The quantity of material re iuired for
the medium size (10 years) is 11 yards
of embroidered Uouncing Z Inches
deep. yards of plain niatei ial 38
inches wide, with yards of Inser
tion to make as illustrated: or 5 yards

the city. The comm'sslon decided that
as the hour was late, it would not take
the matter up until this morning when
it will meet again at eight o'clock for
aii inspection of the plans. The plans

go over them personally with
the commission and explain the de
tails. In the making of these plans Mr.
Putter has done a great deal of work
that is perhaps valuable only a.s educa
tional and is o.uile interesting to the
people to know about. Nevertheless it
wes necessary for him to do It. only
under a liberal interpretation or his
contract with the city. His contract
provided that he should consider every
possible plan for a gravity system, a
pumpin? sysiejri. or any other system
that could he constructed for J3"0.0i".
Put the rigure itself practically elim
inated everything except a "nearby
pumping plant for the more compre

ot ine amount stipulated. Though
action has been taken ...
yet, it may very suf-ly be
that Phoenix will have a

similar to the prevent system.

Upton Sinclair's novel of Chicago. "The Jungle." is
the story of a Lithuanian family in "Paclingtov.'n."
and we believe there has been no such overwhelm,
ingly realistic novel of American life hitherto. It is
not the book to entertain cr amuse; it is not a book
for boys or girls; it is a bock which many readers
will say is too horrible. Yet the publishers were so
convinced that it would make a profound impression
and would have an enormous sale that they err.ployed
an able lawyer to no to Chicago and investigate
"Packingtown" conditions, that they
might be sure they could in fairness

For the Soul of Rafael
The Season's Successful Romance
A Novel of Southern California, by Marah Ellis Ryan
When Keith Brytan went to Mexico to look up some mining property, he came upon a strange
hill tribe cf India. is. And after he had been "struck down and well, used up." as he said, he
was saved and nursed hack to life by a lovely Mexican girl whose name he did not learn. Nor
did he see her again uitil after she had married Rafael de Arteaga. the worthless scion of a
noble race. Here is the situation at the beginning of this fascinating romance of Old Cali
fornia, and here a -e the principal characters. Perhaps you will think that the happiness of
Bryton and the girl hs loved so reverently are worth far more than the soul of Rafael, but
they did not think so, and that is what makes tne story. It is a splendid story, of the kind that
charms without fie least effort, because of its inherent strength and sincerity. The outward
appearance of the book is worthy of its contents. It is not nossible to ade- L f f f
