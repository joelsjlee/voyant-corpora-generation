cutive action in the case of Fred D.
Warren, editor of theAppeal to Reason
of Girad, Kans., whose sentonce of
six months in Leavworth piison and
lino of $1,500 for violating the postal
regulations has just been affirmed by
United Stated Circuit Court of Appoals
of St. Paul. Warren's conviction i9
characterized by Sinclair as an "in
credible travesty upon justice," and a
llagrant case of the persecution of a
man for his political opinion." War
ren's ciffcr.se was sending postal cards
through the mails offering a reward
to anyone that would "kidnap a re
publican politican, former Gov. Taylor,
uf Kentucky, under indictment in
Kentucky for the murder of Gov.
Goobel, from Indiana," where he was
then living. Warren's action followed
the capture and transfer from Colorado
to Idaho of William D. Haywood,
Charles II. Moyer and George Petti
bone accused of the murder of Frank
Steunonberg.

Murderer Confesses.
Trenton, N. J., Nov. 25.?John
Sears confessed today that ho killed j
Minister Amzi L. Armstrong and his
wife to get a share of the minister's es-!
tato that was coming to him in the
will after the preacher's death. j
The double murder was committed
at Dutch Neck, nine miles east of this ;
city Wednosday night. Sears is a;
half-breed negro.
Rachel Sears, mother of the man.
who boa been a servant in the Arm
strong family nearly forty years, is also
under surveillance. The police have
been working oil the theory that only
some ODe who new intimately the
habits of the ministor aud his wife
could have committed the crime. This
fact, and the discoverey that the
rnothor of the Sears told an entirely
different story from that of her son
caused the police to work on Sears.
The apartments wore not looted and
the gun with which tho shooting is be
lieved to have been done was one which
Sears had borrowed from a neighbor
on November 14.
Sears, under cover of night took the
prosecution and detcctives to the scene
of th? murder and showed them where
he had hidden tho stolen watch of the
dead pastor. He told them how he
committed the crime in a dramatic
gcene in the conrt house. His mother
twill be arrested.
Sears, according to bis confession,
planned to kill both the minis
ter and his wife, believing that bis
mother, the only other occupant of the
Hou^e, would not inform on him.
Sears said also he had an idea that if
he got rid of the old couple their wealth
would come to him. In describing his
actions, Sears said be went to New
Brunswick as he intended about 8
o'clock Wednesday evening, but re
turned shortly afterwards. Entering
the house with his shotgun he first shot
the aged woman as she advanced to
to meet and then turned on the, minis
ter and shot him.
