WAR INVOLVES
FATE OF JEWS.
While race prejudice finds an un
congenial soil in America, it, is indigenous
in other place# in the world
and has been during many centuries.
The thousands of Hebrews in the j
United States, where they hear not
the oppressor's voice, often have their
attention called to the terrible experience
through which members of
are race are passing in other climes,
where Jew-baiting continues. The
present war in Europe has brought
additional distress to many, and they
are kept moving from place to place
under cruel conditions.
The fate of half the Jews of the j
world is trembling in the balance as
a result of the great war in Europe,
.according to Rabbi Moses J. Grics,
of Cleveland, president of the Central
Conference of American Rabbis,
who addressed its twenty-sixth convention
at. Charlevoix, Mich., yesterday.
"A crisis impends for Israel," said j
Rabbi Cries. "The million Jews of.
Eastern Europe are buffetted from ;
persecutor to oppressor.
' "All mankind has been made eyewitness
to Belgium's misery and sorrow.
Galicia and Poland suffer equal i
tragedy, but the world neither sees j
nor hears. Millions of Jews, always
in want and wretchedness, now experience
cruelty intensified. Hundreds
-of thousands .are sacrificing
their lives for their country, yes, j
even for the flag of t$ie oppressor,
and no promise of freedom is clearly !
spoken. The Joyal offering of life.'
in a nation's cause, should quench the I
fire of anti-Semitism in Germany and j
Austria anil kindle the litrht. of free- I
dom?with equal human rights in i
Russia.
"Not yet is there any abatement;
of Russian persecution, nor any j
change in the legal status, nor any j
removal of disabilities. Again thous-;
ands of Jews have been compelled to
take up the staff of the wanderer, ex- i
polled from their homes and native;
villages, the aged and the infirm and j
mothers with unborn babes facing
staiwation and the danger of death, j
The outrageous inhumanities have j
stirred even a George Brandes to the!
indictment of Poland in the forum of
nations, and Israel Zangwill pro- i
claims, 'Polish Jews are living;
through one of the greatest traged- i
ies in history.'
"Again, in the face of world-wide
misery, we discover ourselves unpre-!
pared and unorganized. To meet
overwhelming disaster we endeavor to
create national and international I
agencies. We are never ready, j
though Jews are ever in distress and
have not vet escaued the voke of t he !
world's cruelty, oppression and per-1
secution."
o
POISONING
OF WELLS.
The mecuods of the Germans in
poisoning the water supply when
forced to retreat in South Africa
which are described in a dispatch
from a British officer at Aus, German
Southwest Africa, brings to mind
a number of sad scenes in connection
with past wars.
Many years ago France, had a tilt
with Tunis. On that occasion the
Tunisians caused the French gre^t
distress by poisoning the wells. The
war occurred during the heated term
and the Tunisians managed to place
poison in virtually all the wells i.i
the vicinity of hostilities, and the
French soldiers, after causing tne
natives of the country to retreat, followed
them up. The invaders were
almost famished for water, but upon
reaching wells they found them offering
instant death to any one who
drank of the water. It became necessary
for the French to place guards
at every well, as it was known that
'the soldiers, frantic from heat and
thirst, would drink of the water, alv
+v,oir knew death would folysft?
distress after the first
of full Run from lack of wafederal
soldiers had seized
S and snrjngS for the use
-r * - |I
of the wounded and horses, and sol- i
|diers were kept from them at the 1
point of the bayonet. ]
We who live in a country where i
water is as free as the air we breathe
have no realization of the discomfit
I often experienced in climes where waiter
is a luxury. In the tropics.it is
'necessary to boil most water before
I it can be used for drinking purposes.
' wiiiiom -Tonninpns Brvan. after mak
ing a tour of the world, delivered a
lecture in the Opera House in Alexandria.
He referred to the scarcity
j of drinking water in some countries,
[especially parts of India. . On~some
I occasions when suffering from thirst
; and heat, he and his party came to
j wells where there was an abundance
j of water, but of a quality which car[
ried disease and probably death, and
none of the party drank of it. He said
none but those who have experienced
it know the feeling occasioned by be:
ing compelled to pass by water when
I tortured by heat and thirst. The com(moner
said he longed for the time
when he would be again beside the 1
well in his home in Nebraska, where
he could drink ad libitum.
o
DR. WILEY'S
"DISCOVERY."
]
If the hat factories of the world 1
were closed down now there wouldn't
be a single baldheaded person in the
next generation, in the opinion oi
Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, health expert.
Dr. Wiley, in all seriousness, yester- '
day laid the blame for shiny tops on
the practice of wearing hats.
"I believe," said the doctor, "that
if men would stop wearing tight-rim- '
med hats, that stop the proper cir- '
culation of blood to the head, we 1
wouldn't have any bald heads. I *
would urge this upon small boys especially,
that they may be saved the .
annoyance and often the embarrassment
of a bald head."
Should Ihe doctor's suggestion begenerally
adopted, a wail of woe ?
would ascend) from thousands who
make their living by manufacturing
and selling caputical coverings. But. j
is it a fact that covering the heau
produces baldness? Wc prefer some j
further proof before discarding our j
hats. In ancient days most people ^
did not wear head coverings. This
is shown by paintings, statues and
busts which have been unearthed in ,
cities of bygone days. Many busts j
of the ancients show that philosop- (
hers, politicians and generals wcte j
as bald as those of our day. We have .
all read the story of the little ones (
who insulted the prophet Elisha by (
calling him a bald head.
o
PRESENT DAY t
OCEAN PERILS. ]
t
The iceberg, fog and derelict are .
standing menaces to ocean travel, t
although the thousands who have ]
crossed and recrossed in past years |
have seldom realized these dangers, s
but have laid themselves down to
sleep with hut little thought of what
might happen. It is not so now, how- j
ever, and we read of passengers on (
ocean steamers sitting up all night s
in their steamer chairs ready for any (
eventuality. The dangers mentioned ]
above fade cwhsn it is realized that |
when once the '"war zone" is enter- 5
ed ships are in peril and likely to j
meet the fate of the giant Cunardei
and her many passengers.
Extraordinary precautions to safe- <
guard passenger lives in case of sub- y
marine attacks were taken by otfi- ]
cers of the White Star Finer Cymric ]
which recently reached Liverpool !
from New Y'ork. i
Every passenger aboard the liner <
was supplied with a life belt and <
taught how to put it on shortly after 1
leaving New York. Under the direction
of officers the passengers and
crew were rehearsed in the act of <
getting quickly into the boats. I
Entering the Irish Sea passengers <
were ordered to adjust ineir mc
belts, boats were swung out and i
made ready to be lowered instant- '
i lv and double lookouts were estah- I
! lished. Officers (Jeclare these pre- '
j cautions reassured some nervous pasr 1
. sengers who feared the Cymric might
meet the fate of the Lusitania.

ANIMOSITIES
; OF THE WAR.
j '
The hatred of the warring nations
against each other was manifested at |
; the beginning of the present war. J1
; The Russians immediately changed)
~e "onitnl from St. !
! tne name uj. im.li
! Petersburg to Petrograd, and when
i they invaded Hungary they changed
i the name of Przemsyl to Peremysl.
; The work of changing is still in proi
gress, and the Germans, in retalia'
tioti, are taking steps to eliminate
! ever yword from the Teuton vocabu|
lary which has a foreign root. The
New York Tribune in referring to
i this movement says:
Since the beginning of the war;
there has been a strong movement in
! Germany to exclude words of foreign
origin from common use. The Ger- j
ALEXANDRIA GAZETTE
man language is to be purified and
thoroughly re-Germanized. Some
persons in the Fatherland, however,
are opposed to the change.
The German Reichstag recently
passed a resolution requesting the
Imperial Chancellor to cut all expressions
of foreign origin out of the
next annual budget. Dozens of good
technical terms will have to be replaced
with made-to order Germanisms.
The Reichstag will also have
to reform its own vocabulary, and
the army will hardly know itself
when "artillerie," kavallerie," "major,
"leutanant," "feld Marschall"
and a hundred other familiar technical
terms are thrown into the discard.
NEWS oT THE DAY
An important diplomatic document,
with reference to the war is being
prepared by Pope Benedict XV.
The German losses in Galicia are
estimated at 380,000 and the Austrian
losses at approximately the

The German government has decided
to adopt the same measures for
the conservation of this year's crop
ef grain as were employed last year,
expropriating alll grain and fixing
maximum prices for its sale. The
expropriation will be in the hands of
the communes, however, and the
maximum prices will not be fixed until
it is seen exactly how the harvest
turns out. The same measures will
apply to fodder.
